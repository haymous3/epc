                        <h3>What's on the IELTS?</h3>
                        <p>The IELTS is divided into four sections, each of which focuses on one language skill. Thesections are: Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking.For Listening, Reading, and Writing, you get a test booklet with pre-printed questions.</p>
                        <p>Unlike many other standardized tests, the IELTS is not a computer-generated test that isviewed onscreen. You enter your answers on paper with a pencil instead of using akeyboard. Multiple versions of the IELTS exist, each with
                            a different mix of questions. Thebooklets are changed often, to prevent cheating. The Speaking section is an interview,and is scheduled separately from the rest of the exam.</p>
                        <p>There are two versions of the IELTS: Academic IELTS and General Training IELTS. As youmight guess, Academic IELTS is used for school admissions. General Training IELTS isused most often for immigration and employment. However,
                            Academic IELTS is still usedfor medical jobs and medical skilled migration. The Academic and General Trainingversions of the exam have the exact same Listening and Speaking sections. </p>
                        <p>However,the Reading and Writing sections on these exams are somewhat different.Below, we’ll take a closer look at each of the four sections individually. And later in thebook, each part of the test gets its own chapter.</p>

                            <h3>The Reading Section</h3>
                            <p>The Reading exam lasts one hour and consists of 40 questions. The Academic IELTScontains three passages. Even though they are written at a college or university level, the passages do not require in-depth subject matter knowledge.
                                Time management is a keyskill for the Academic Reading exam. It can be challenging to read each passage andanswer all of the questions in time. The General Training Reading section contains three(or sometimes four) passages.
                                The first focuses on a very basic topic from dailylife — information about public transportation, a community notice, etc. The secondsection contains two short informative passages that are typically related to school,
                                work,or community topics. The third (and possibly fourth) passage is a longer essay or article.

                            <h3>The Listening Section</h3>
                            <p>The Academic and General Training IELTS have the same Listening exam. It contains fourpassages, each with 10 questions (40 questions total). During the first 30 minutes,test-takers listen to the passages and mark answers in
                                their test booklets as they listen.
                            </p>
                            <p>Each recording is played only one time. The first two passages are usually about topicsfrom daily life, while the last two are more academically oriented. The language getsincreasingly challenging from the first recording to
                                the last.
                            </p>
                            <p>After each recording has been played, there is a 10-minute period in which test-takerstransfer their answers from the test booklet to the answer sheet. Only answers submittedon the answer sheet will be graded.
                            </p>

                            <h3>The Speaking Section</h3>
                            <p>The IELTS Speaking exam is an in-person interview. It can be scheduled on the same dayas the paper exam, or up to one week before or after the paper exam. Check with yourlocal exam center to see when Speaking exam appointments
                                are available for you.
                            </p>
                            <p>The interview takes 11–14 minutes and contains three sections. In the first section, theinterviewer asks very basic questions about general topics: family, hobbies, travel,interests, etc. The second section is a prepared monologue.
                                Test takers have a minute toplan an answer to several prompts related to a specific topic or question. In the third segment of the test, the question and answer format resumes. However, this time thequestions are more abstract,
                                requiring complex language and vocabulary from you. Thequestions will relate in some way to the topic of the monologue in the previous section.

                            <h3>The Writing Section</h3>
                            <p>The IELTS Writing exam involves writing two short passages in one hour. Task 1, which isworth ⅓ of the score, must be at least 150 words long. Task 2 is worth ⅔ of the score andmust be at least 250 words long.
                            </p>
                            <p>On the Academic IELTS , Task 1 involves summarizing the most important informationfrom charts, graphs, diagrams, and/or other visual prompts. On the General TrainingIELTS , test-takers write a letter for Task 1. The topic and
                                purpose of the letter (i.e. tocomplain, request information, etc) is provided in the prompt. Task 2 is a formal academic essay. In the second IELTS Writing task, test-takers willrespond to an essay prompt. They will need
                                to give their opinion on an issue, supportingtheir point of view with details and examples. IELTS Writing Task 2 is the same on bothversions of the test.

                            <h3>What is a Band Score?</h3>
                            <p>Let’s start with the basics of scoring. Your official IELTS score will be expressed as a“band.” There are nine bands on the IELTS, numbered 1 through 9 in half-pointincrements. So the following IELTS scores are possible: 5.5,
                                6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, etc. Test-takersreceive a band score for each of the four test sections (Reading, Writing, Speaking,Listening), and also an overall score, which is simply the average of the four section scores.
                            </p>
                            <p>Many standardized English tests—including the TOEFL—make adjustments to scoresbased on the difficulty of the questions a particular test-taker answers. So, for instance, ifyou take the TOEFL and get a harder-than-average mix
                                of questions in a Reading section,your reading score will be raised on your official score report. This doesn’t happen on the IELTS. Instead, your official IELTS Reading and Listeningscores are based on your raw score —the
                                score that is calculated immediately in thetesting center.
                            </p>
                            <p>Each section contains 40 questions, and although raw score to band scoreconversions can differ slightly from one test to another, they basically follow the pattern. For Writing and Speaking, band score distinctions are fairly
                                easy to comprehend. IELTSpublishes a version of the grading schema they use to assess these two skill areas
                            </p>

                            <h3>What is a Good IELTS Score?</h3>
                            <p>Regardless of why you’re taking the IELTS, the better question to ask is probably, “Whatis an acceptable IELTS Score?”The IELTS score is used by a vast number of institutions and organizations to figure outwhether or not your
                                English is ‘good enough’ for eligibility – immigration, admissions,hiring, etc. If you are taking the IELTS for immigration, what they’re looking for willdepend on kind of visa you need (e.g. work, business, for investors,
                                for students, etc.). Ifyou’re taking the IELTS as an international student, both the government and theinstitution may have a say about what is acceptable. So needless to say, there’s no oneanswer to the question of what
                                a good IELTS score is. But all institutions will give youguidance on what an acceptable score is for the institution’s purpose. It’s also quite important to remember that institutions don’t just require different IELTSscores.
                                Different organizations also sometimes require different versions of the test.
                            </p>
                            <p>IELTS Academic is used for school admissions and medical jobs. IELTS General Trainingis used for just about everything else; it’s the go-to exam for immigration and mostemployment. And the score requirements for General Training
                                can be very different,depending on the visa or job. This makes perfect sense. After all, a factory worker won’tneed the same English proficiency as a technical writer, to give just two examples.</p>

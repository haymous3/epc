                        <h3>What’s on the TOEFL?</h3>
                        <p>The TOEFL iBT is divided into five sections, each of which tests one language skill. Thetest isn’t adaptive, which means the questions don’t get harder if you do really well oreasier if you get a few questions wrong. Multiple forms
                            of the test exist and they changeoften, which helps to prevent cheating, but all of the tests are close to equally difficult.You can learn about each of the four sections individually below, and later on, we’ll dedicate an
                            entire section to each part of the test.
                        </p>

                            <h3>The Reading Section</h3>
                            <p>This first section tests your ability to understand academic written English. The material inthis section may be different from the English you’ve read before, especially if you readfiction or popular literature, because it
                                is based on material that English-speaking collegestudents are expected to read and understand. So it’s a good idea to get familiar withthis style of writing. The reading passages can cover a wide variety of topics includingart,
                                history, science, and social sciences, which we’ll cover later on.You will have one hour to read the three reading passages and answer the accompanying questions. After the full text is printed, questions will be grouped
                                byparagraph, which saves you some time and makes it easier to find the information youneed. You will see some unfamiliar words in this section, but that’s OK–if the word isnecessary, can’t be figured out from context, and
                                is specific to the topic of the text (notused in normal English), the test may allow you to click on the word and get a definition. Each question is worth the same amount, so don’t get stuck for too long on one question.You
                                will have 20 minutes per passage, including the questions.

                            <h3>The Listening Section</h3>
                            <p>Now that your language skills are warmed up, you’ll move on to listening, which will testyour ability to understand both academic lectures and conversations related to universitylife. Like the reading section, the listening
                                section will last about an hour. Throughout theentire test, you will have the option of taking notes; in the listening section, this will beessential. Practice listening and writing at the same time, because the lectures
                                are 3-5minutes long, and you will not be able to remember all the necessary information. Theconversations will be shorter, but note-taking will still be very helpful. In all you will listento 4 or 6 lectures and 2 or 3
                                conversations.
                            </p>

                            <p>The speaking section is the shortest, lasting about 20 minutes. It will involve someindependent tasks, which require you to express an opinion briefly (you will have up to aminute to speak), and some integrated tasks, in which
                                you will need to use informationfrom reading and listening in your spoken answers. There are two questions that requireyou to read, listen and speak, and two that require you only to listen then speak. In allyou will answer
                                6 questions in the speaking section.

                            <h3>The Writing Section</h3>
                            <p>As in the speaking section, you will complete an integrated task (20 minutes) and anindependent task (30 minutes). The independent task is a persuasive essay, meaningyou should express and support an opinion. The integrated
                                task will give you an excerptfrom a lecture, an excerpt from a written article, and a question. Your task will be tocombine the information from the lecture with that from the written article in order toanswer the question.
                                Manage your time well! On the TOEFL you will use a standardQWERTY keyboard. If you need to, now is a good time to practice typing in English, asyou will not want to waste time searching for the right letter on the keyboard.

                            <h3>The Experimental Section</h3>
                            <p>Generally speaking, we consider the TOEFL to have an hour of reading, an hour oflistening, twenty minutes of speaking, and fifty minutes of writing. But you may havenoticed that there’s some flexibility in the schedule: the
                                reading section, officially, can besixty or eighty minutes, and the listening section may be just an hour or an hour and ahalf. This is because there are extra questions in one section of the test—the"experimental section."
                            </p>
                            <p>All tests include an additional set of listening or reading questions that aren’t graded.This gives ETS a chance to find any flaws in new material before it really matters. It's atrial for new exam questions.The experimental
                                section will be either an extra reading passage (20 minutes) or an extraset of listening prompts (up to 30 minutes) --not both.
                            </p>
                            <p>The experimental section will be randomly placed. If it’s a reading passage, of course, allthe experimental questions will be together, as they will deal with the same reading; if it’sin the listening section, however, the
                                experimental listening samples will be interspersedwith the graded ones. Don’t waste your time trying to guess which section is theexperimental one. " Experimental" questions do not look different from graded questions.
                                If you think you’ve identified the experimental section and you don’t try as hard on it,your score will suffer if you are mistaken.

                            </p>
                            <p>In spite of the additional time and energy the experimental section will cost you, you mayfind that knowing what to expect in it helps calm your nerves. It means that if a readingpassage is very difficult for you, it won't
                                necessarily hurt your scores; it is possible thatreading is experimental. So if there is a text or lecture that baffles you, answer the questions to the best of your ability, but use the knowledge that it may be experimentalto
                                keep yourself on track.

                            <p>Unfortunately, the TOEFL score scale isn't the most straightforward. So hopefully we canmake it a little bit clearer for you.

                            <p>Like any standardized test (e.g. the GRE, GMAT, SAT…) the TOEFL has its own uniquescoring system. It is not a percent-correct score, so getting 100 on the TOEFL doesn’tmean you’re a native speaker!Instead, the maximum score
                                on the TOEFL is 120. The test is broken into four parts, andthe scores reflect that. Each of the four sections—reading, listening, speaking, andwriting—is worth 30 points. Generally speaking, graduate school or college
                                programs donot look seriously at the individual scores, though: the combined score out of 120 is themost important number.

                            <p>Unlike most other tests we take, you can’t pass or fail the TOEFL. No score can really besaid to be “good” or “bad", just as no level of English is inherently “good” or “bad”—it alldepends on what kind of language you use and
                                what you need it for. Fortunately, mostuniversities take the guesswork out by stating exactly what score you need to qualify fortheir programs. There’s a huge range here: some schools require a score as low as 70 points,
                                and others as high as 110. From a practical standpoint, the score required by the school you’reinterested in should be considered a “good” score.

                            <p>Unlike most other tests we take, you can’t pass or fail the TOEFL. No score can really besaid to be “good” or “bad", just as no level of English is inherently “good” or “bad”—it alldepends on what kind of language you use and

                            </p>
                            <p>If you’re taking the SAT or GRE, you may have noticed the culture of scraping up as manypoints as possible; it’s not uncommon for people to spend months and months studyingand then take the test multiple times over a period
                                of six months or a year. There’sabsolutely nothing wrong with this, since even a fairly small increase in score can giveyou the competitive edge that gets you admitted or wins the scholarship that allows you to attend the
                                school of your dreams.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The TOEFL, however, is a little different. If a school states a score, then the office ofadmissions has determined that that score is what’s necessary to perform well in thatschool’s curriculum. So as long as you meet the requirement, your score probably
                                won’tplay much of a role in your admission or rejection. Let’s say you were sick the day of yourtest, and you didn’t perform your best. You scored a 95, but you think you should havescored a 100. If your program only requires
                                a 90, then it’s probably not worth taking thetest again. Instead, focus on other parts of your application that the admissionsdepartment is more interested in, like your essays, interviews, and portfolios.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Of course, this is different at every school in every program. If you are trying foradmission to a top graduate school, the minimum score might be 90, for example, but in order to get a TA (a teaching assistantship), your minimum speaking score might
                                be 26.Research your schools well to find exactly what they want from you. When you get your TOEFL scores, they will be accompanied by a document called“performance feedback.” This document will contain a summary of your
                                general level,including strengths and weaknesses. It breaks the score into 3 levels, so you can use thatinformation to figure out how good your score is in a very general sense.

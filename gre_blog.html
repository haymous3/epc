                            <h3>What Exactly Is New About the GRE?</h3>
                            <p>The GRE has been around in one form or another for decades, and this newest versionrepresents the latest set of “improvements” on the test. The following are the mostsignificant differences between the current GRE and the former
                                GRE:The old GRE was adaptive by question, which means that your performance on one question influenced the selection of the next one, and you couldn’t skip or go backto questions. The new GRE is adaptive by section. This
                                means that the difficulty ofthe second section depends upon your performance on the first, but you can jumparound within a section.
                            </p>
                            <p>The new test is longer; while the old test was 2 hours and 30 minutes long, as wepreviously mentioned, the new test is a bloated 3 hours and 40 minutes—and that’swithout any introductory modules or an experimental section.You
                                get to use an on-screen calculator on the GRE now! There are a bunch of new question types, including multiple-choice questions,multiple-choice questions with more than one correct answer, fill-in-the-blankquestions, select-in-passage
                                questions, and other strange-looking questions.
                            </p>
                            <p>The new test has a new scoring system; the old test was graded on the same 200–800 scale as the SAT, but the new test is graded on a 130–170 scale in one-point increments.
                            </p>
                            <p>Analogies and Antonyms, which were two very vocabulary-dependent questions onthe old test, have been eliminated. They do not appear on the new test.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="each_sections">
                            <h3>So why was the test changed? </h3>
                            <p>Well, ETS, the company that makes the GRE, claims thatthe changes were made to “increase the validity of the test, address security concerns,increase worldwide access to the test, [and] make better use of advances in technologyand
                                psychometric design.”The test is now longer and less convenient to take, and it contains a number ofnew question types that have yet to be tested in depth.

                            <h3>How Much Does the GRE Matter?</h3>
                            <p>Some programs consider the GRE very important, while others view it as more of aformality. Because the GRE is used for such a wide range of graduate studies, therelative weight it is given will vary from field to field and
                                from school to school. Amaster’s program in English literature will not evaluate the GRE the same way as a PhDprogram in physics, but it’s hard to predict what the exact differences will be. A physicsdepartment may care
                                more about the Math score than the Verbal score, but given thatnearly all of its applicants will probably have high Math scores, a strong Verbal scoremight make you stand out and help you gain admission.

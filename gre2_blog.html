                            <p>The Revised GRE will consist of two Verbal sections, two Quantitative sections, and one experimental section, which can be either Verbal or Quant. The experimental section will not count towards your score. You will receive
                                an overall Quantitative score in the 130 to 170 range, and an overall Verbal score, also from 130 to 170. Thus, the Revised GRE is out of 340. </p>

                            <p>For the computer-based exam, the Verbal sections contain 20 questions each. You will be given 30 minutes to complete each section. The Quantitative sections also consist of 20 questions each, but you will have 35 minutes to
                                complete each section.

                            <h3>The Quantitative Sections </h3>
                            <p>The Quantitative section is made up of about 7 Quantitative Comparison Questions and 13 non-Quantitative Comparison questions (a majority of which will be Multiple Choice, with a few (1-2) Numeric Entry and Multiple Answer
                                questions each).
                            </p>
                            <p>Multiple Choice is pretty standard—you’ll just have to identify the one possible correct answer. Multiple Answer can have up to 10 answer choices, and you’ll have to “select all that apply”, which means that the number of correct
                                answers is also unknown.

                            </p>
                            <p>Numeric Entry is an open-ended question type in which you will have to type in the correct value. Quantitative Comparison will list two quantities, A and B (anything from algebraic expressions to the side length of a given
                                geometric shape) and ask you to compare them and select one of the following: A is equal to B, A is greater than B, A is less than B, or that the relationship between the two quantities cannot be determined from the information
                                given.
                            </p>
                            <p>Additionally, there is a basic on-screen calculator that you will have access to during the Quantitative sections.</p>

                            <h3>The Verbal Sections </h3>
                            <p>The Verbal Section is made up of about 6 Text Completions, 4 Sentence Equivalence questions, and 10 Reading Comprehension questions.
                            </p>
                            <p>Text Completions can have one to three blanks, and range from short sentences to a four-sentence paragraphs. For two- and three-blank Text Completion questions, you must answer each blank correctly to receive full points—no
                                partial credit!
                            </p>
                            <p>Sentence Equivalence questions have six possible answer choices. For every Sentence Equivalence question, there will be two correct answers. To receive any credit, you must choose both correct answers. Reading Comprehension
                                passages range from 12 to 60 lines. Topic matter is usually academic in nature and covers areas such as science, literature, and the social sciences. Question types include standard multiple-choice questions, highlight
                                the passage questions, and multiple-answer questions, which require you to choose any one of three possible answer choices.

                            <p>To begin the test, there are two essays, and you’ll be given 30 minutes for each: The Issue and The Argument. Neither is part of your 130 – 170 score. Each essay receives a score ranging from 0 – 6. Your final essay score is
                                the average of both essay scores.
